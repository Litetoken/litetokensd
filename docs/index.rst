czarcraftd
==================================================

Czarcraft is a protocol for the creation and use of decentralised financial instruments such as asset
exchanges, contracts for difference and dividend payments. It uses Litecoin as a transport layer.
The Czarcraft protocol specification may be found `here <https://github.com/CzarcraftDLA/Czarcraft>`__.

``czarcraftd`` is the reference client (and server daemon) implementation of the Czarcraft protocol.

To get ``czarcraftd`` installed and set up on your computer, you have two options:

- Set it up manually, using the instructions `here <https://github.com/CzarcraftDLA/czarcraftd/blob/master/README.md>`__
- For Windows and Ubuntu Linux users, you can use the `automated build system <http://czarcraft.io/docs/build-system/>`__

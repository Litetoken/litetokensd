worldpartyd
==================================================

Worldparty is a protocol for the creation and use of decentralised financial instruments such as asset
exchanges, contracts for difference and dividend payments. It uses Worldcoin as a transport layer.
The Worldparty protocol specification may be found `here <https://github.com/WorldpartyXBJ/Worldparty>`__.

``worldpartyd`` is the reference client (and server daemon) implementation of the Worldparty protocol.

To get ``worldpartyd`` installed and set up on your computer, you have two options:

- Set it up manually, using the instructions `here <https://github.com/WorldpartyXBJ/worldpartyd/blob/master/README.md>`__
- For Windows and Ubuntu Linux users, you can use the `automated build system <http://worldparty.io/docs/build-system/>`__

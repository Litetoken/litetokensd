bluejudyd
==================================================

Bluejudy is a protocol for the creation and use of decentralised financial instruments such as asset
exchanges, contracts for difference and dividend payments. It uses Worldcoin as a transport layer.
The Bluejudy protocol specification may be found `here <https://github.com/BluejudyXBJ/Bluejudy>`__.

``bluejudyd`` is the reference client (and server daemon) implementation of the Bluejudy protocol.

To get ``bluejudyd`` installed and set up on your computer, you have two options:

- Set it up manually, using the instructions `here <https://github.com/BluejudyXBJ/bluejudyd/blob/master/README.md>`__
- For Windows and Ubuntu Linux users, you can use the `automated build system <http://bluejudy.io/docs/build-system/>`__
